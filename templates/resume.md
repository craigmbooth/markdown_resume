Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

Technical Experience
--------------------

Programming Languages
:   **Python:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **C/FORTRAN:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file).

:   Basic knowledge of **Shell scripting**, **PHP**

Side Projects
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * Data visualization appeared in the Denver Post, Washington Post, Business Insider,
    * Second item.
